	<LI>Due to the increasing number in Covid-19 situation, we have a strict regulation and was advise to stay at home during this pandemic.</LI>
	<li>I generally become an insider and doing a lots of things at home to reduce my boring time, so rather than do nothing I often cook and also marathon a lots of korean drama during this holiday.</li>
	<li>My studies also was influenced by the pandemic but lucky me having a good friends to help when I'm in stress. Shout out to my two best girl Anis and Shaza. Let's not give up and continue this together until we graduate!!</li>
	<li>I hope that this pandemic will end faster so that we can continue our daily life in a normal way again. Stay safe fella! ^^</li>
